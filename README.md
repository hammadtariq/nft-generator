## Overview
This repository contains source codes from [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/) lessons.


## How to run
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/deploy.js OR npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
npx hardhat help
```

## How To Use
You can simply clone the project to your local storage with following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/hammadtariq/nft-generator.git
```

Or fork it to modify the sample codes for your own study.

If you found any error in the codes while you study, Feel free to submit pull requests or issues.
